[16:23:02] <fhackdroid> anjali, kushal , sayan are one of them ! aren't they teaching you stuff?
[16:23:15] <anjali> yes
[16:23:43] <fhackdroid> what you have to ask are you taking your time off and trying to learn from them ?
[16:24:52] <anjali> i did not get your question
[16:25:07] <fhackdroid> anjali, if you are talking about the FOSS project mentor once you start contributing you are helped by people and they become your mentor

[16:25:53] <meamitk> What do you think,  can my server administration experience help me to contribute in Open source community ? <EOF>
[16:27:44] <fhackdroid> anjali, you just have to ask the right question at the right place ! finding bugs are not that difficult
[16:28:10] <rahuldecoded> angali it's difficult only because you are new to this. It won't be this difficult after you get started.
